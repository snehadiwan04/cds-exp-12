# Experiment 12

## Aim :
To study and implement Constructors and Destructors 

## Software :
Vs code

## Theory :

### Constructors :
Constructors are unique member functions of a class that are automatically called when an object is created.<br> The objectâ€™s data members are initialized. Resources may also be allocated when required.

There are some key points about constructors which are: 
- The name of the constructor is the same as its class name. 
- Constructors do not have a return type. 
- Constructors are mostly declared in the public section of the class. 
- Multiple constructors can be defined with different parameters, which is known as overloading.
There are mainly 3 types of constructors.
They are: 

### Default Constructor:
A constructor which takes no arguments. It is also called a zero-argument constructor as it has no parameters. 

### Parameterized Constructor:
A constructor that takes parameters, allowing the object to be initialized with specific values.

### Copy Constructor:
A constructor that initializes an object using another object of the same class. It is used for deep copying and when passing objects by value. 
<br>

### Deconstructors - 
A destructor is also a special member function like a constructor.
- Destructor destroys the class objects created by the constructor.
- Destructor has the same name as their class name preceded by a tilde (~) symbol.
- It is not possible to define more than one destructor.
- The destructor is only one way to destroy the object created by the constructor. 
- Destructor neither requires any argument nor returns any value.
-  It is automatically called when an object goes out of scope.
-  Destructor releases memory space occupied by the objects created by the constructor.
